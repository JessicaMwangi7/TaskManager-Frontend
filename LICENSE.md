# SpendWise - Personal & Collaborative Expense Tracker

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing personal and shared expenses efficiently is a common challenge. Many individuals struggle to track their spending, set budgets, and collaborate with others on shared financial responsibilities. Popular expense tracker applications often lack intuitive collaboration features, making it difficult for families, roommates, or business partners to manage joint expenses.

SpendWise aims to solve these problems by offering a comprehensive and user-friendly expense tracking platform. The application will allow users to create and manage wallets, set budgets, categorize expenses and incomes, and collaborate with others through shared wallets. With a mobile-responsive UI and insightful dashboards, users will gain full visibility into their financial habits, helping them make informed decisions.
