Project Idea:Task Flow - A Collaborative Task Management System

Project Description:
Develop a collaborative task management system that enables users to manage tasks both individually and within a team. Users can create, prioritize, and assign tasks, set due dates, and track progress.It promotes seamless team communication,with ease of use, and secure user interactions.

Requirements:

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

User Authentication:
Secure user sign-up, login, and logout functionality.

Task Management:

Create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Assign tasks to specific users.

Prioritize tasks (high, medium, low).

Set deadlines and status updates.

Filter and sort tasks based on criteria.

Real-Time Collaboration:

Integrated chat feature using Firebase for team communication.

Responsive Design:

Optimized layout for various devices.

Backend: Flask (Python) + PostgreSQL

User Management:

Secure User registration, login, and authentication.

Task Management:

API for CRUD operations.

Stores task metadata like title, description, due date, status, priority, and assigned user.

Database:

PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for data handling.

Consider scaling to cloud-managed DB for production use.

API Endpoints:

RESTful endpoints for user authentication and task handling.

User Acceptance Criteria:

Users can register and access their own tasks securely.

Tasks can be created, edited, deleted, and filtered.

Tasks can be assigned and prioritized.

Users can collaborate through real-time chat.

Interface remains user-friendly and responsive on all devices.

User data is protected and managed securely.

Components for the Frontend:

Authentication Components:

Sign-up form

Login form

Logout functionality

Task Management Components:

Task list and detail views

Task creation/editing forms

Priority and due date selectors

Task assignment dropdown

Chat Components:

Firebase-based chat room per user/team

ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the Database:

User Table:

user_id (Primary Key)

username

password_hash

Task Table:

task_id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key)

title

description

priority (High, Medium, Low)

due_date

status (e.g., In Progress, Completed)

assigned_to (Foreign Key to user_id)

Additional Details:

Security:

Implement secure password storage and token-based authentication using JWT.

Testing:

Write unit tests for backend endpoints.

Run frontend integration and usability tests.

Deployment:

Deploy backend on Render or Railways

Deploy frontend on Netlify 

Logging & Monitoring:

Add console logging and error reporting for debugging.

Documentation:

Include README files, setup guides, and API documentation.


This project provides a complete full-stack development experience, demonstrating skills in authentication, RESTful API design, frontend component architecture, real-time communication, and database relationships. It is ideal for a mid-level developer aiming to showcase their ability to build collaborative, secure, and scalable web applications.
